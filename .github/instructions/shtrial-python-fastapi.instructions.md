# Python Coding Conventions

## SHTrial Platform Context

These instructions apply to applications running on the **SHTrial Platform** - a unified DigitalOcean infrastructure with shared resources and per-app logical isolation.

### Platform Overview
- **Cluster:** `sh-demo-cluster` (NYC3, Kubernetes 1.34.1, CPU-only)
- **Database:** Shared Postgres 16 (`sh-shared-postgres`) with per-app databases
- **Storage:** Shared Spaces bucket (`sh-storage`) with per-app prefixes
- **AI Services:** DigitalOcean GenAI serverless inference
- **Deployment:** Automated via `scripts/k8s-deploy.sh`
- **Configuration:** `.env.shared` as single source of truth

### Key Standards
- **Naming:** `{APP_SLUG}` pattern for all resources (namespaces, databases, prefixes)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.12) or Fastify (Node 22) only
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 App Router or Vite 7
- **AI:** LangGraph for orchestration (no proprietary DSLs)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui components
- **Package Management:** Poetry (Python) / pnpm (TypeScript)

### Configuration Management
All configuration must reference `.env.shared` variables:
- Never hardcode URLs, credentials, or resource names
- Use environment variables for all external services
- Reference platform resources by standard names
- Follow template patterns in K8s manifests (`` substitution)

### Platform Reference
- **Standards:** `shtrial-demo-standards.md` - Complete platform documentation
- **Implementation:** `.pendoah/platform/docs/` - Detailed guides
- **Templates:** `.pendoah/platform/templates/` - Code and config templates

## Python Instructions

- Write clear and concise comments for each function.
- Ensure functions have descriptive names and include type hints.
- Provide docstrings following PEP 257 conventions.
- Use the `typing` module for type annotations (e.g., `List[str]`, `Dict[str, int]`).
- Break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable functions.

## General Instructions

- Always prioritize readability and clarity.
- For algorithm-related code, include explanations of the approach used.
- Write code with good maintainability practices, including comments on why certain design decisions were made.
- Handle edge cases and write clear exception handling.
- For libraries or external dependencies, mention their usage and purpose in comments.
- Use consistent naming conventions and follow language-specific best practices.
- Write concise, efficient, and idiomatic code that is also easily understandable.

## Code Style and Formatting

- Follow the **PEP 8** style guide for Python.
- Maintain proper indentation (use 4 spaces for each level of indentation).
- Ensure lines do not exceed 79 characters.
- Place function and class docstrings immediately after the `def` or `class` keyword.
- Use blank lines to separate functions, classes, and code blocks where appropriate.

## Edge Cases and Testing

- Always include test cases for critical paths of the application.
- Account for common edge cases like empty inputs, invalid data types, and large datasets.
- Include comments for edge cases and the expected behavior in those cases.
- Write unit tests for functions and document them with docstrings explaining the test cases.

## Example of Proper Documentation

```python
def calculate_area(radius: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate the area of a circle given the radius.
    
    Parameters:
    radius (float): The radius of the circle.
    
    Returns:
    float: The area of the circle.
    
    Raises:
    ValueError: If radius is negative.
    """
    if radius < 0:
        raise ValueError("Radius cannot be negative")
    return 3.14159 * radius ** 2
```

## Async Programming

- Use `async`/`await` for I/O-bound operations.
- Prefer `asyncio` for concurrent execution.
- Use `aiohttp` or `httpx` for async HTTP requests.

## Dependencies and Virtual Environments

- Use `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for dependency management.
- Always use virtual environments (`venv`, `virtualenv`, or `uv`).
- Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds.

## Error Handling

- Use specific exception types rather than bare `except:`.
- Log errors with appropriate context.
- Use `try`/`except`/`finally` blocks appropriately.
